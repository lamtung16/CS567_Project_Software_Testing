# CS567 - Software Testing
As part of the CS567 course, I undertook a project that involved the application of advanced testing techniques to evaluate simple Python code. Leveraging the testing tools TSTL and MutPy, I aimed to enhance the reliability and robustness of the software. TSTL provided a systematic approach to generate test cases, while MutPy and UniversalMutator played crucial roles in introducing mutations to the codebase, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of my test suite. This project not only deepened my understanding of software testing methodologies.
